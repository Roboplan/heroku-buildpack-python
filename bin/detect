# This script serves as the

# detector.
#
# A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Python application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1
SEED_RUNNER_DIR=$1/seed_runner

# Exit early if the scripts are missing
if [ ! -f $SEED_RUNNER_DIR/install.txt ] && [ ! -f $SEED_RUNNER_DIR/run.sh ] && [ ! -f $SEED_RUNNER_DIR/uninstall.txt ]; then
  exit 1
